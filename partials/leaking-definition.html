<p>Leaking (ðŸ“£ lÄ“k), leaked, leaking, leaks.</p>

<p>Leaking is a material phenomenon in different fields such as chemistry, computation/electronics, whistle blowing, crying that always point towards an opening of an already porous body or system. This shifting computational (and not) process opens a contingent space that undoes the solidity of non/human artifacts and frameworks.</p>

<li>In Electronics: happens when electrons leave the path they are supposed to flow on because a conducting material meets another conductor. Example: When the isolation of a wire breaks, it touches salt water, which is also a conductor. A leak results in the loss or corruption of electrons or data.</li>
<li>From Faces: When crying. Example: "I'm leaking!", said the Grinch.</li>
<li>In Social Relations: Occurs when people leak sensitive or private information, for example unreleased game footage or classified information. A constant maintaince of keeping people from 'spilling over'. Example: Chelsea Manning released information on war crimes to be public.</li>
<li>In Computation: a constant performance of refreshments of bits in memory to prevent a leak (1). Example: DRAM memory is refreshed at the rate of milliseconds. Reference: In Habits of Leaking: Of Sluts and Network Cards the theorist Wendy Hui Kyong Chun and the filmmaker Sarah Friedland argue that 'new media are not simply about leaks: they are leakâ€˜.</li>
<li>In Sluttiness: Chun and Friedland describe how network cards connect computers with networks in a default mode that is called â€špromiscuousâ€˜ since it is specifically the openness of network cards towards any and all internet traffic that makes it possible to interconnect computers. These basics of network technology are, according to Chun and Friedland leaky, and â€žtechnically speaking, initially â€žsluttyâ€œâ€™. Through this lense, slutiness is celebrated as leaking (7).</li>
<li>In Kitchens: A messy spill with a sicky fluid in your fridge. Example: The jam from my friend had a small hole in its container and now my entire fridge has liquid jam on its surface.</li>
<li>In Elemental Relations: When the mercury cries (a kind of sound of it crying/leaking). Example: When mercury is frozen with nitrogen oxide it makes a cracking noise when it is broken in half.</li>
<li>In Networks: A way of relating between internet nodes. Example: The p2p Gossip protocol is inspired by how people  â€žspill overâ€œ and thus leak social data.</li>
<li>In Political, Electronic, Artistic contexts: It has a subversive potential because it is about leaving the connection from a to b. Example: By leaking out of disciplines T*FTS (Trans*Feminist TechnoScience) undoes the boundaries of previously worked with intersections.</li>
