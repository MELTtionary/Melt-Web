<p>Permeating (ðŸ“£ perÂ·â€‹meÂ·â€‹abilÂ·â€‹iÂ·â€‹ty | \ ËŒpÉ™r-mÄ“-É™-Ëˆbi-lÉ™-tÄ“ \) permeated, permeable, permeability.</p>

<p>Permeating is a material property that connects differently structured and structuring substrates. It proposes a surface with an uncertain depth and can't necessarily be percieved by human senses. Permeating frames devices that scaffold possibilities of contact.</p>

<li>In Material: Enables material practices of â€šreaching throughâ€˜ instead of just â€šseeing throughâ€˜. Permeating is a mode of leaking.</li>
<li>In Interfaces: Along an interface, that manifests for example as a membrane or between otherwise incompatible programming scripts, an exchange happens between different structured and differently structuring materials. These materials co-constitute each other through the specific configuration of their interfaceâ€™s permeability. Permeating is oftentimes too small or not vocal enough to be perceived by human senses and especially by human eyes.</li>
<li>In Process. Interfaces are zones, and open-ended. Reference: With Alexander Galloway we argue that â€šInterfaces are not things, but rather processes that effect a result of whatever kind.â€˜</li>
<li>In Haptics: Not visual per/say, different to transparency.</li>
<li>In Reaching: Reaching through vs seeing through. This makes permeating a matter of access. Example: Reaching into a box to try and identify the material or things inside. Is it cold spaghetti? Is it a blanket? Is it melting ice? Example: Instead of calling for decision making to be transparent, ask for it to be permeable.</li>
<li>In Recognition: Not fully making something available. Example: Lace or beaded curtains do not fully close off a space, nor do they make it fully open to enter.</li>
<li>In Boundaries: Wifi-waves as permeating architectures and bodies. Permeating suggests that no body or system is closed and that there is no 'outside'.</li>
<li>In Membrane: The prosity of the membrane determines the entire possibility.</li>
<li>In Surfaces: Oftentimes is to do with the surface, mediating entity.</li>
<li>In Framing: Framing device for variable perspectives. Pearmeating undoes rectangular shapes and enclosed structures. Example: A french press has a porous aluminium structure through which coffee floats.</li>
<li>In Non-Binary: Permeating is not an either/or binary process, it proposes modes of both/and.</li>
<li>In Electrochemistry: Semipermeability is employed in electrochemical applications. Example: Batteries.</li>
<li>In Collectivities: Nothing is ever seperate, all is conditionally connected.</li>
