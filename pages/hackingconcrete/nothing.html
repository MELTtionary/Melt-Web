            <h1>Pace</h1>
            <p>"We learn to pace ourselves, individually and collectively, to be sustained long term. We value the teachings of our bodies and experiences, and use them as a critical guide and reference point to help us <a href="../hackingconcrete/move.html">move</a> away from urgency and into a <a href="../hackingconcrete/slow.html">deep, slow, transformative</a>, unstoppable wave of justice and liberation." - SINS Invalid in The basis of the Movement is our People: 10 Principles of Disability Justice</p>
