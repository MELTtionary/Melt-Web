      <h1>Churning Concrete</h1>
      <p>"Access is <em id="concrete">concrete</em> resistance to the immense isolation that disabled people face <a href="../hackingconcrete/everyday.html">everyday</a>. But I don’t want us to just make things “accessible,” I want us to build a political container in which that access can take place in and be grounded in. Access for the sake of access is not necessarily libratory, but access for the sake of connection, justice, community, love and liberation is." – Mia Mingus in Access Intimacy, Interdependence and Disability Justice</p>
