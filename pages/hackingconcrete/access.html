            <h1>Hacking Metaphors</h1>
            <p>The assumption that we can presume the existence of a shared understanding and knowledge of bodily (including sensory and cognitive) experiences that will serve as the <em id="concrete">concrete</em> concept through which we figuratively communicate abstract ideas (as metaphors of disability do) is, however, very problematic. By and large, such presumptions rely upon allegedly universal experiences of the body: everyone sees, speaks, hears, feels, and moves in the same (nondisabled) ways (see Vidali 2010). - Sami Schalk in Metaphorically Speaking: Ableist Metaphors in Feminist Writing</p>
