    <p>This research project (2022-23) focused on a speculative computational object titled Imagining Backwards Computer and was activated through a series of imagination workshops in which computational steps were followed by participants in order to write up unwritten pasts.</p>
    <p>The Imagining Backwards Computer engages AI (algorithmic instability / ancestral intelligence) to imagine backwards in time. Time itself is a thriving material with which we can engage to imagine otherwise hirstories. Hirstories are different from "his" stories and move away from cis-gendered assumptions of who's story is being told. This project breaks with algorithmic habits of aggregating and predicting from today‘s oppressions.</p>

    <h2>Pedagogies of Imagining Backwards</h2>
    <p>During workshops we engaged collections: sometimes collected objects from our everyday lives, other times archival materials. In processing these sources into data, we took appreciation as our method, and asked: What engagements with our trans* and disabled presents/elders and their/our artifacts that supported our/their lives might there be? And what descriptions of longing & connection serve trans* and disabled experiences and which ones don't?</p>

Various wavy computer interfaces of folders, terminals and windows float atop the structure in blue and rose transparencies. Letters across read: Collecting things, Processing your data, letter of appreciation, imagining. On the lower end of the structure, there is an opening and the words 'Imagination for a different future' fall out of them.">
