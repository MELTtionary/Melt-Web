    <h1>Flowing, Patterning and Pacing</h1>
    <p>Flowing, Patterning and Pacing is a sculpture developed for Britzenale 4 that unfolds trans* and autistic gestures informed by our bodyminds in and within climate catastrophe.</p>

    <img data-interchange="[/assets/img/antiableist/flowing1-s.jpg, small], [/assets/img/antiableist/flowing1-m.jpg, medium], [/assets/img/antiableist/flowing1-l.jpg, large]" alt="A fluorescent pink sculpture emerges out of a garden with many small plants in the foreground and background. The structure looks spider like with many dancing legs. Flowing down the center of the sculpture is a burlap painting with scenes of trans* and disabled thriving - stitched into the weave are gestures from visitors to the sculpture, rehearsing our collective thriving in resisting climate change.">

   
    <p>Triangular wooden structures fit into one another and are built to hold each other, temporarily. This fluorescent pink dry-fit construction reaches about 2,5 meters tall and uses no glue or screws to stay together. Pressure and pegs hold the weight through a series of slanted, skewed and queer joints. The structure resembles support elements that form a triangle around the trunk of young trees so that wind and other forces don’t stop them from growing and sustaining fine roots in loose soil. In our work as MELT, wedges are methods that hold open doors and other pathways, and that can be driven into structures that exclude (MELT 2021). In Flowing, Patterning and Pacing, triangular wedges split normative ideas of fixedness and fixing, and trans* gestures hold open multiple strategies of recombination – this form withstands, but it’s not fixed, and it can reappear otherwise, determined by different grounds and the joy of holding on and reaching out.</p>
      
    <p>Held atop the wooden structure, flowing burlap fabric unfurls downwards and shares imaginaries of climate justice futures. Planned, stenciled and painted onto the burlap are roots, rocks and sprouts with pathways for visitors to embroider into. Emerging from science fiction stories, like the autistic main character of Octavia Butler’s Parable of the Sower who packs a survival kit that allows her to grow not only plants but a new community. Through repeating other embroidered notations or scripting and following the laid out plans for flourishing, visitors are invited to grow and sit amidst change as still and as calm as a rock. In this work scripting is a method that allows us to rehearse our collective coalitional flourishing amidst climate catastrophe.</p>

Six long triangular wedges that are part of the the front leg are connected via small round wooden elements, and because each element is angled differently, a zig-zag pattern emerges that gives the leg a spiderlike appearance.">
