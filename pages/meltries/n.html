        <h1>never odd nor even</h1>
        <p><a href="https://overexposed.sonicacts.com/never-odd-or-even/" target="_blank">never odd nor even</a>, is a wobbly plane for non-normative ways of experiencing, theorising, materialising, subverting, and being in time. Through navigating this website through the Map, 'Colophon’, ‘Meditation’, ‘Lecture’ and ‘Ice’ different temporalities open. Time stretches into the past through collective and ancestral memories and into the future with meditations for Trans* and Disabled futures. As you visit the website you are invited into non-linearity, loops, circles, palindromes, discontinuities, slowness, and attention to pace in your time with this website.

          The artwork, never odd nor even, is interwoven across at least two types of media: a website and an article in the Sonic Acts Book. The transparent inlay that you find on the ‘Map’ if you visit https://overexposed.sonicacts.com/never-odd-or-even/ is also available as a physical sheet folded into the Sonic Acts magazine.
