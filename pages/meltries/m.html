          <h1>melting Manifesto</h1>
          
          <li><p>Melting proposes a physical method of liquifying and changing the state of that which was considered stable.</p></li>
          <li><p>Melting proposes a way of understanding things through change instead of through definition.</p></li>
          <li><p>Melting proposes a change of state through heat, encounter or another friction.</p></li>
          <li><p>Melting is not neutral, it has violence within it as a concept. It dissolves material as a method itself. This is dangerous for some, but life-affirming for others.</p></li>
          <li><p>Further, human technologies and ongoing histories of colonial violence further the melting of polar ice caps and subsequent rising sea levels which are threatening to life on Earth; this is felt unequally through situated perspectives.</p></li>
          <li><p>Melting is opposed to classification and categorization. It is a material en/counter practice.</p></li>
          <li><p>Melting offers alternative assemblages of condensing, liquifying, and embracing dissolution.</p></li>
