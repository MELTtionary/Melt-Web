          <h1>Bug Report: Tuning to trans*feminist Xystem.Crash</h1>
          <p>on 31 October 2020 at ZAK Zitadelle Berlin with Katrin KÃ¶ppert</p>
          
          <p>Engaging the bug report as a trans*feminist practice of affirmative critique that tunes to conceptual, political or material problems within existing systems. We invited writers to describe and problematize bugs at the intersection of computation, magic and decolonial theory. A bug report within computational practice is a document detailing what is observable about a piece of software that is not performing a dedicated task. In 1946, programmer Grace Hopper invented the term when operators found a moth in the Mark II computer. We engage the bug report as an anti-racist and trans*feminist practice of affirmative critique that tunes to conceptual, political or material problems within existing systems. Borrowing from Mozilla's bug report writing guidelines, we have distilled key trans*feminist debugging techniques towards naming problems within the processes that produce glitches, crashes and violences.</p>
          <p>Join us for an evening of reading bug reports, discussing further implications and giving time and attention to collective bug finding on 31 October 2020 at <a href="https://www.zitadelle-berlin.de/ausstellungen/disturbance-witch/">Zitadelle Berlin</a>
            -- further information will be updated <a href="https://www.hgb-leipzig.de/hochschule/kalender/923">on the website of HGB Leipzig</a>.</p>
