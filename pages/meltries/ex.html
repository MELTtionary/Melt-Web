            <h3>Archiving the Unstable</h3>
            <p>Archiving the Unstable is a video that shows 3D models of materials such as ice blocks as well as their projections onto fabrics. Ice, water and vapor are materials that change a lot. This is why scanning them is very difficult. The work asks what can and cannot be captured.</p>

            <p>In the video Temporal Drift, white peopleâ€™s hands hold one ice block as long as they can. The hands shake from the coldness while the ice block melts more and more. Whenever holding the ice block causes too much pain, the person passes it on. </p>
