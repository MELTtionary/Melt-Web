            <h3>Archiving the Unstable</h3>
            <p>Archiving the Unstable is a video that shows 3D models of materials such as ice blocks as well as their projections onto fabrics. Ice, water and vapor are materials that change a lot. This is why scanning them is very difficult. The work asks what can and cannot be captured.</p>

            <h3>Temporal Drift</h3>
            <p>In the video Temporal Drift, white peopleâ€™s hands hold one ice block as long as they can. The hands shake from the coldness while the ice block melts more and more. Whenever holding the ice block causes too much pain, the person passes it on. </p>

            <h3>Hacking Concrete</h3>
            <p>Hacking Concrete is a website artwork and installation that shows filmed experiments with concrete. Concrete comes up in different forms such as dust, mush and hardened rock. These experiments work towards more access for disabled people. On the floor there are sculptures made of latex, dirt and concrete and on the wall there is a projection of the website work.</p>
  
            <h3>Heating Matters / Change Flux</h3>
            <p>Heating Matters / Change Flux is a video that shows experiments with melting and discusses themes around technology and climate change.</p>
