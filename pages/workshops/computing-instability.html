        <h1>Computing Instability: Notational States of Matter in H20</h1>

        <h2 style="font-size: 1.8em;">Online Workshop on Thursday 15.07.2021, 10am - 2pm CET</h2>
        <p>During Computing Instability: Notational States of Matter in H20, we will work with the chemical element H20 through a series of writing exercises. In this workshop we will both write prompted by pre-determined operations and be prompted to invent our own poetic operations. Water changes its state of matter within a temperature range of 0 to 100 degrees. Transitions from ice to water to gas can be easily set in motion through the heat of hands, kitchen freezers and cooking. Water itself poses challenges to technological recording practices: cameras that are not specifically protected corrode when put into water, and capturing softwares such as 3D scanners have trouble recognizing the "edges" of ice cubes and instead scan what they see "through" the ice. What becomes perceptible when refusing stability and "captureability"? How is instable H20 a material-epistemic witness (Schuppli)?</br></br>
        This workshop is commissioned by <a href="https://counter-n.eu">counter-n</a> and will be hosted by the art-design duo MELT (Loren Britton & Isabel Paehr) and inspired by their ongoing research project The Meltionary. The Meltionary is a growing experimental directory that investigates different materials, metaphors and modes of melting. MELT researches realities generated by climate change, questioning how coloniality, climate change and technological developments are intertwined (Da Silva). To pursue these questions, MELT boils up insights from chemistry, crip technoscience and trans*feminism to both study and set in motion transformative material-discursive processes.
