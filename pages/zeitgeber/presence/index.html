    <img data-interchange="[/assets/img/zeitgeber/presence1-s.jpg, small], [/assets/img/zeitgeber/presence1-m.jpg, medium], [/assets/img/zeitgeber/presence1-l.jpg, large]" alt="As part of the installation, a tablet hangs from the ceiling with the website artwork open. On it, sentences in violet color read: 'Future logics emerge from love which includes and exceeds calculation as one of our uncountable love modes. We (disabled and trans* people) are in the future. A thriving future is one that includes disabled and trans* people.' The background behind the tablet is blurry, and on the right side, a pink glass lampshade can be made out.">
    <p>At the Sonic Acts Biennale 2022 the meditation 'PRESENCE-PAST, PRESENCE-PRESENT, PRESENCE-FUTURE: Trans* and Disabled Timelines' invited visitors online and offline to get cozy and join in together, meditating towards pleasurable future-presents for trans* and disabled people. Via a QR code that visitors outside the gallery could scan to join, and with cozy cushions that visitors in the space could sink into and meditate with, we practiced making space for feeling into our presences.

      The Sonic Acts Biennale ‘one sun after another’, was curated by Margarita Osipian, W139, Amsterdam, NL. Coding support for our artwork in collaboration with Karl Moubarak. Photos were taken by  Elodie Vreeburg, George Knegtel, Amie Galbraith and Pieter Kers.</p>
