      <p style="display: none">Video description: A white person's hand places a transparent piece of paper atop the screen of a laptop that has the website artwork neveroddoreven opened in a Browser. On the website, animations of a plant, a blanket and a black hole play and shine through the transparent paper that has still images of these animations printed on it. When still image/illustration and animation overlap, sound pieces become visible as pink dots on the page.</p>

    <p style="margin-top:1em;">neveroddoreven is a prism of art works intersecting trans* and crip time: a wobbly plane for non-normative ways of experiencing, theorizing, materializing, subverting, and being in time. A website, an installation and an article tell and interweave stories of temporal experiences that engage in divergence.</p>

    <h2>website & article</h2>
      
      <p>As you visit the website you are invited into non-linearity, loops, circles, palindromes, discontinuities, slowness, and attention to pace - tuning into your own experiences of time. Through navigating this website's folds 'Map', 'Colophon', 'Meditation', 'Lecture' and 'Ice', different temporalities open.</p>
       
      <h3>Map</h3>
      <p>In 'Map' time stretches into the past through collective memories shared by family and friends. On a starry sky background and/or soundscape, audio pieces are hidden and can be found by placing lively animations atop still images. Those who have a physical copy of the <a href="https://sonicacts.com/archive/magazine-ecoes-issue-3" target="_blank">Sonic Acts ECHOES #3 magazine</a> can use the included paper inlay for navigation.</p>

Captions on the side read 'how sometimes the way from the bed to the kitchen seems like it might take 5 hours, and the way to the bathroom 3.'">

      <h3>Meditation</h3>
      <p>In <a href="https://overexposed.sonicacts.com/neveroddoreven/meditation" target="_blank">'Meditation'</a> time moves into the future with the work 'PRESENCE-PAST, PRESENCE-PRESENT, PRESENCE-FUTURE: Trans* and Disabled Timelines' to meditate towards accessible futures.</p>

A newly unfurled phrase from the meditation is displayed, it reads ‘We (disabled and trans* people) are in the future. A thriving future is one that includes disabled and trans* people.">
    

      <h3>Lecture</h3>
      <p>'Lecture' holds the recording of our lecture 'the future is not a point we meet but a trouble we travel' shared during the Sonic Acts Symposium <i>Leaving Traces</i> in October 2022.</p>

      <h3>Ice</h3>
      <p>With <a href="https://overexposed.sonicacts.com/neveroddoreven/ice" target="_blank">'Ice'</a> we present a video about the pain of climate change temporalities on an embodied level as the hands of white people hold blocks of ice until the cold hurts too much.</p>

      <h3>Colophon</h3>
      <p>In 'Colophon', we thank Karl Moubarak and Margarita Osipian for collaborating on this artwork, Robin Rutenberg for recordings, as well as friends and colleagues for their treasured contributions. Our article, <i>neveroddoreven: a wobbly map for time travel</i>, is available as <a href="https://overexposed.sonicacts.com/neveroddoreven/colophon" target="_blank">a screen reader accessible PDF for download</a> and it is printed in the Sonic Acts ECHOES #3 Magazine with a physical transparent leaflet which activates the website otherwise. neveroddoreven was produced as part of the Sonic Acts residency programme Overexposed 2021 and the Sonic Acts Biennale 2022.</p>
