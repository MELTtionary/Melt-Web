        <h1>Archiving the Unstable</h1>
        <p>U - Archiving the Unstable unfolds through multiple non-linear narratives that we melted within the <a href="https://www.flusser-archive.org/" target="_blank">Vilem Flusser archive</a> during the <a href="https://transmediale.de/projects/vil%C3%A9m-flusser-resident-2021" target="_blank">transmediale residency</a> in the hot summer of 2021. 
          Unfolding experiments through Boiling, Folding, Fragments, Surfaces, Orientation, Sorting, Imagined Bottoms + Technological Belief, the video follows material transformations and failures of 3D technologies to capture shape shifting matters. </p>
