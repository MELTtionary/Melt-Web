            <h3>Archiving the Unstable</h3>
            <p>Archiving the Unstable is a video that shows 3D models of materials such as ice blocks as well as their projections onto fabrics. Ice, water and vapor are materials that change a lot. This is why scanning them is very difficult. The work asks what can and cannot be captured.</p>
