          <h1>Meltionary: Heating Matters/Change Flux</h1>
          <p>Heating Matters/Change Flux is a video work that unlocks metaphors of melting in times of climate crisis and explores unstable states of matter. Colliding theories and practices from chemistry, trans*feminism and computation, this dictionary-like assemblage is invested in moments of material transformation. We take things not seriously, but literally when we turn up the heat and film, perform and learn about how they melt. In 'Heating Matters / Change Flux' we will warm up and melt down corrosive colonial relations (whiteness), climate change realities (melting ice caps) and computational practices (overclocking and burning hoverboards). We'll investigate the textures, dimensions and representations of stability and what melting as a practice has to offer.</p>
