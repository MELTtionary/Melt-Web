        <h1>Hacking Concrete</h1>
        <p>Hacking Concrete is an interactive online space with three storylines on patching, decomposing and sprouting with concrete. Concrete in its many states is visible, audible and readable in the displayed footage, and its materiality unfolds in the forms of dust, mush, cracks and other soft and hardened structures. Tending to concrete’s materiality, we experimented with refusing access barriers that are caused by hardened structures. In the forms of videos, images, sounds, and texts, the concrete in our work remains ‘open’ as a material that is not yet ‘set up’ or cured or hardened. We both studied concrete as dust, powder, slush or goo, and as a metaphor in language when it is used to express that something is to be made solid or fixed. This work studies ways that concrete unforms and operates otherwise than it is colloquially considered to be: solid as rock.</p>
        <p>The work is currently <a href="http://meltionary.com/hackingconcrete/start.html">on display online</a>.</p>

But I don't want us to just make things "accessible," I want us to build a political container in which that access can take place in and be grounded in. Access for the sake of access is not necessarily libratory, but access for the sake of connection, justice, community, love and liberation is." - Mia Mingus in Access Intimacy, Interdependence and Disability Justice">
